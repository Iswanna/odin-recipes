This recipe project comprise of a full course meal which is made up of an appetizer, main course, dessert and a cocktail drink. This recipe is inspired by one of my favourites and I would love to share its goodness recipe with the world.
I would be using html knowledge in designing the web pages. I used the boilerplate coupled with some html elements to design this web page(s) and they are as follow: html elements, head element and body element. Few tags were used within each of the elements mentioned above and this includes: meta charset tags, title tags, heading tags, paragraph tags, link tags and image tags. image tags and meta charset tags are semantic tags beacause they do not have closing tags.I also made use of both absolute and relative type of links in designing the website.
