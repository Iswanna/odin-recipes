        <h2>Description</h2>
          <p>Jollof rice is a popular West African recipe that consists of rice cooked in a spicy tomato stew. 
            The heat from the scotch bonnet is much more than your usual chilli, so you might want to use half 
            it if you don't like things too spicy></p>

            <li>1 small red onion, diced</li>
            <li>5g curly leaf parsley, roughly chopped</li>
          </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Put the rice in a bowl of water to soak while you make the sauce. Put all the ingredients for the 
              sauce into a blender or food processor and blend with a little salt and pepper. Pour into a lidded 
              saucepan and put the lid on. Bring to a medium simmer for 10 mins, until simmering, then season 
              generously with black pepper and a pinch of salt.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, in a large lidded frying pan, add coconut oil and melt over a medium heat. 
              Add the onion and pepper and coat in the oil. Add the thyme, bay and all the spices. 
              Stirring all the time, cook for 1 min. Add the tomato puree and black pepper. Cook for 1 min, 
              then pour the blended sauce into the pan with the spices and bring to a medium simmer. 
              Strain and rinse your rice thoroughly before pouring into the sauce. Put a piece of foil over the 
              saucepan before putting the lid on. This will help seal in the steam.</li>
            <li>Turn the heat to low and cook the rice for 20-25 mins. Remove the lid, add the butter and stir the rice, 
              it will be cooked through and a little sticky. If it's too sticky add a little more stock or boiling water 
              and stir.</li>
            <li>To serve, top with the diced fresh tomatoes, red onion and parsley.</li>
