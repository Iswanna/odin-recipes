        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a perfect meal for an appetizer. It is an intensely flavoured soup served throughout West Africa especially in Nigeria, Cameroon and 
            other neighboring African countries. The only ingredient that is inherently present in this soup is Pepper, 
            the rest is fair game.</p>
        <p>The basic ingredients that you need in other to enjoy pepper soup is hot pepper, onions, garlic, ginger 
            then the list goes on with ethnic spices that range from lemon grass to more universal spices like allspice, 
            cumin, curry, fennel seeds. I kept this recipe simple , so anyone, anywhere can try this soup. Use any protein 
            of choice ( goat meat, chicken, fish,  beef, ovals). For the purpose of this recipe, I will be using chicken 
            specifically.</p>
